/**
 * Utility class re-throws unchecked exceptions for lambda expressions without the need for the caller to surround his
 * lambda expression with a try/catch.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Having a code snippet like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import java.io.IOException;
 *
 * public Integer getId() throws IOException {
 *     // ...
 * }
 *
 * public void foo(Supplier&lt;Integer&gt; integerSupplier) {
 *     // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * when calling this method with:
 *
 * <pre>
 * foo(() -> getId());
 * </pre>
 *
 * a compiler error is generated because checked exceptions must be surrounded with a try/catch block and looks
 * something like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * foo(() -> {
 * 	try {
 * 		return getId();
 * 	} catch (IOException e) {
 * 		// usually
 * 		throw new MyAwesomeException("something bad happened", e);
 * 	}
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * which effectively makes the caller of the method handle the exception anyway. This class helps simplify this by
 * automatically re-throwing the exception to the caller:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import static org.morphix.lang.function.ThrowingSupplier.unchecked;
 *
 * foo(() -> unchecked(() -> getId()));
 * </pre>
